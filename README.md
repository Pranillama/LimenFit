# LimenFit

LimenFit is a minimal, high-speed fitness tracker built to prioritize the fastest possible set-logging flow — target: under three seconds per set. The architecture centers on resilient active workout sessions (optimistic UI, offline queuing) and a clean activity history. AI-assisted form analysis is planned for a later phase. The stack is Next.js 15 App Router, React 19, TypeScript strict mode, and Supabase (database + auth + storage).

## Where things live

> **Note:** Route directories without a `page.tsx` or `route.ts` are intentionally inert — Next.js only activates routes when those files exist. Placeholder `README.md` files mark ownership; implementation is listed by ticket.

## Public routes

The following routes are publicly accessible without authentication:

- `/` — landing page placeholder (this ticket, T1).
- `/plan/[slug]` — public shareable plan page (T13).

The T4 implementer must ensure both routes bypass auth checks. The two recommended approaches are:

- **Omit them from `config.matcher`** — middleware only runs on paths listed in the matcher, so leaving `/` and `/plan/[slug]` out means the middleware never executes for those requests.
- **Use a negative-lookahead matcher** — write a single regex pattern that matches all paths _except_ `/` and `/plan/:slug`, e.g. `/((?!plan/).*)` extended to exclude the root.

Alternatively, the middleware function itself may early-return `NextResponse.next()` when `req.nextUrl.pathname` matches those paths, but the matcher-exclusion approach is preferred because it avoids running middleware code at all.

---

## Environment variables

Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local` and fill in the values before running the dev server.

| Variable                        | Required     | Description                                                                     |
| ------------------------------- | ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`      | Yes          | Your Supabase project URL                                                       |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` | Yes          | Supabase anon/public key                                                        |
| `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`     | Yes (server) | Service role key — never exposed to the browser                                 |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL`          | Yes          | Canonical site URL (no trailing slash) — used by `robots.txt` and `sitemap.xml` |
| `NODE_ENV`                      | No           | Defaults to `development`                                                       |

`lib/env.ts` validates all variables at import time and throws a single readable error listing every missing or invalid variable. The server variables are guarded by a browser Proxy that throws if accessed in client bundles.

Removing `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` (or running with no `.env.local`) causes any module that imports `lib/env` to throw the readable Zod schema error at import time, listing every missing or invalid variable. The current `app/page.tsx` deliberately does **not** import `lib/env` (directly or transitively), so the landing page continues to render even without environment variables — only modules that actually need env will fail. As of T2, all four modules under `lib/supabase/` import `@/lib/env`, so any Server Component, Route Handler, or client bundle that transitively imports a Supabase client factory will now fail at boot if a required env var is missing. The T1 prediction that “T4 will introduce the first real consumer via `lib/supabase/server`” is now satisfied earlier by T2.

---

## Local Supabase backend

The local backend (Postgres, Auth, Studio, Storage, Inbucket) is managed entirely by the Supabase CLI through Docker. There is no custom `docker-compose.yml` in this repo — `pnpm db:start` is the single command to bring everything up. Production Docker assets are owned by T16.

First-time setup:

1. Install and start **Docker Desktop**.
2. Run `pnpm db:start` — the CLI boots the stack and prints the local API URL and anon key when ready.
3. Copy the printed `API URL` and `anon key` values into `.env.local` (also set `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` from the printed service role key).
4. Run `pnpm dev`.

```bash
# Requires Docker Desktop to be running
pnpm db:start   # boots the local stack; prints connection URLs when ready
pnpm db:stop    # shuts it down and releases ports
pnpm db:reset   # re-runs all migrations + seed.sql (wipes local data)
```

See `supabase/README.md` for the full workflow including migration verification.

## Deployment

Vercel auto-deploys on every merge to `main`. Pull requests each receive a Vercel Preview deploy. GitHub Actions provide the quality gate but do not perform the deploy — Vercel's Git integration handles all production and preview deployments independently.

### Vercel project settings

| Setting          | Value                                                               |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Framework Preset | Next.js                                                             |
| Node version     | 20.x                                                                |
| Package manager  | pnpm 9.15.0 (auto-detected from `packageManager` in `package.json`) |
| Install Command  | `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile`                                    |
| Build Command    | `pnpm build` (default)                                              |
| Output Directory | `.next` (default)                                                   |
| Root Directory   | repo root                                                           |

### Environment variables (Vercel)

Set the following in the Vercel project under **Settings → Environment Variables**, scoped to both **Production** and **Preview**:

| Variable                        | Description                                                                               |
| ------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`      | Supabase project URL                                                                      |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` | Supabase anon/public key                                                                  |
| `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`     | Service role key — server-only, never exposed to the browser                              |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL`          | Canonical site URL (e.g. `https://limenfit.com`) — used by `robots.txt` and `sitemap.xml` |

See `.env.example` for the variable names. In CI (`ci.yml`), `pnpm build` runs against placeholder values for these three variables purely to satisfy `lib/env.ts`'s import-time Zod validation — the build step does not connect to Supabase. The values set in Vercel must be the real credentials.

### Docker (optional)

`NEXT_PUBLIC_*` values are inlined into client-side JavaScript bundles by Next.js at `pnpm build` time. Because `.dockerignore` excludes `.env*` files (except `.env.example`), `.env.local` is never present inside the build container — you must pass the public Supabase values as `--build-arg`:

```bash
docker build \
  --build-arg NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://yourproject.supabase.co \
  --build-arg NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key \
  --build-arg NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL=https://your-domain.com \
  -t limenfit .
```

`SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` is server-only and never inlined into client bundles, so it can (and should) be supplied at run time — never bake a real service-role key into a build layer:

```bash
docker run --env SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your-key -p 3000:3000 limenfit
```

The `Dockerfile` packages the production Next.js build for runtime parity — useful for smoke-testing the production bundle locally. It is not the deployment mechanism (Vercel handles that via its Git integration). For the local Supabase backend, see `pnpm db:start` above — that is owned by T2 and is entirely separate from Docker deployment.

---

## Migration workflow (remote)

The `pnpm db:start` / `db:reset` scripts in T2 are local-only: they target the Docker-backed Supabase instance on your machine. Production migrations run through a separate path.

**Automated (recommended):** `.github/workflows/supabase-migrate.yml` triggers on push to `main` whenever any of the following paths change:

- `supabase/migrations/**`
- `supabase/seed.sql`
- `supabase/config.toml`

The workflow runs `supabase db push` against the remote project using the secrets below.

### Required GitHub repository secrets

| Secret                  | Source                                                                 |
| ----------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `SUPABASE_ACCESS_TOKEN` | Supabase dashboard → Account → Access Tokens                           |
| `SUPABASE_PROJECT_REF`  | Supabase dashboard → Project → Settings → General → Reference ID       |
| `SUPABASE_DB_PASSWORD`  | Supabase dashboard → Project → Settings → Database → Database password |

### Manual escape hatch

```bash
supabase login
supabase link --project-ref <ref>
pnpm db:push
```

`pnpm db:push` is already wired in `package.json` as `supabase db push`. Use this for one-off fixes or when the automated workflow needs to be bypassed.

### Ordering note

Vercel deploys and the migration workflow run independently in parallel — there is no explicit dependency between them. All current migrations in `supabase/migrations/` are additive (new tables, columns, and indexes only), so this is safe for Phase 1: a deploy landing before a migration means the new schema is not yet visible; a migration landing before a deploy means the app has not yet been updated to use it — neither causes data loss or errors.

If a future migration introduces a breaking schema change (e.g., dropping a column the current app reads), the parallel assumption breaks. Mitigation options at that point:

- **Separate PRs:** merge the migration ahead of the dependent app code in its own PR, confirming the remote schema is updated before the app code lands.
- **Deploy hook:** introduce a Vercel deploy hook that waits for the migration workflow job to succeed before triggering a production deploy.

This is a forward-looking note for Phase 2+, not an action item for Phase 1.

---

## CI/CD pipelines

Two GitHub Actions workflows manage automation for this repository.

### `ci.yml` — quality gate (PRs and pushes to `main`)

Runs on every pull request and every push to `main`. Steps: ESLint lint, Prettier format check, TypeScript type check (`tsc --noEmit`), Vitest test suite, and `pnpm build`. All five steps must pass before a PR can be merged.

The build step runs with placeholder values for all required build-time variables (`NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`, `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`, and `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL`) to satisfy `lib/env.ts`'s Zod validation without a real Supabase project or domain.

### `supabase-migrate.yml` — remote migration (push to `main`)

Path-filtered: only triggers when `supabase/migrations/**`, `supabase/seed.sql`, or `supabase/config.toml` changes on `main`. Runs `supabase db push` against the linked remote project. Requires `SUPABASE_ACCESS_TOKEN`, `SUPABASE_PROJECT_REF`, and `SUPABASE_DB_PASSWORD` as repository secrets (see [Migration workflow (remote)](#migration-workflow-remote) above).

---

## Adding shadcn components

Future contributors should run the following to add new primitives:

```bash
pnpm dlx shadcn@latest add <component>
```

`components.json` already encodes the project conventions (style: `new-york`, CSS variables, neutral base color, `@/components/ui` alias), so the CLI will place files correctly without additional flags.

---

## Phase 1 runtime libraries

The following packages were installed in Phase 1. Most are reserved for later tickets and are unused in the current codebase.

| `@tanstack/react-query-devtools ^5` _(dev)_ | Floating devtools panel — dynamically imported via `next/dynamic`, excluded from production bundles                                                                         | Dev server only                                                          |

React Query Devtools are loaded via `next/dynamic` with `{ ssr: false }` and are **only included in non-production bundles**. The `process.env.NODE_ENV !== 'production'` guard is statically inlined by Next.js, so the devtools chunk is dead-code-eliminated in `pnpm build`.

## Phase 3 expansion (informational)

When the CV microservice lands in Phase 3, the repository will graduate to a monorepo layout with `apps/web/` and `apps/form-analysis/`. The Gemini AI wrapper will live at `apps/web/app/api/ai/` and `apps/web/lib/ai/`.

**Do not pre-create an `apps/` directory in Phase 1** — the migration will be handled as a dedicated task when the microservice is ready.

## Verifying T2 acceptance

Use this checklist to confirm the T2 acceptance criteria are met:

1. `lib/supabase/browser.ts`, `server.ts`, `anon.ts`, and `service-role.ts` all exist and export their respective typed factory functions.
2. `lib/supabase/types.ts` exports a `Database` type (placeholder `Record<string, unknown>` until T3 schema migrations land).
3. **AC3 — NOT currently satisfied:** AC3 requires all four typed client factories to be importable from `@/lib/supabase`. The current `lib/supabase/index.ts` barrel exports only `createSupabaseBrowserClient` and `Database`. The server, anon, and service-role factories are intentionally absent from this barrel to prevent server secrets leaking into client bundles. They are available from `@/lib/supabase/server-exports` (all three together) or directly from their submodule paths (`@/lib/supabase/server`, `@/lib/supabase/anon`, `@/lib/supabase/service-role`). AC3 remains unmet against `@/lib/supabase` unless a future change re-exports the server-only helpers from `index.ts` with appropriate build-time safety guards (e.g., the `server-only` package).
4. `server.ts`, `anon.ts`, and `service-role.ts` each call `assertServerOnly()` at module evaluation time — importing any of them from a Client Component or the `@/lib/supabase` barrel throws immediately.
5. `pnpm type-check` passes with all four factory return types inferred as `SupabaseClient<Database>`.

## Verifying T1 acceptance

Use this checklist to confirm the T1 acceptance criteria are met:

1. `pnpm install` completes without errors.
2. `pnpm dev` starts cleanly with no console warnings; visiting `/` shows the wordmark (`LimenFit`), the verbatim tagline (`Fast workout logging. Soon: AI form analysis.`), and a working `Get Started` CTA pointing to `/auth` (404 expected until T4 lands).
3. Temporarily edit `lib/auth/session.ts` to return a fake `{ userId: 'test' }` — visiting `/` should redirect to `/home` (404 expected until T5). Revert before committing.
4. `pnpm lint`, `pnpm type-check`, `pnpm format:check`, and `pnpm build` all pass.
5. Removing `.env.local` (or omitting `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`) leaves `/` rendering, but importing `lib/env` from a REPL or test harness throws the aggregated Zod issue list.
6. The repository tree matches the "Where things live" diagram above.

## ESLint note

`@typescript-eslint/parser` and `@typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin` are listed explicitly in `devDependencies` so that any future ad-hoc rule overrides have a stable peer to reference, even though `eslint-config-next/typescript` (bridged via `FlatCompat`) already wires them internally.
