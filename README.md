# LimenFit

LimenFit is a minimal, high-speed fitness tracker built to prioritize the fastest possible set-logging flow — target: under three seconds per set. The architecture centers on resilient active workout sessions (optimistic UI, offline queuing) and a clean activity history. AI-assisted form analysis is planned for a later phase. The stack is Next.js 15 App Router, React 19, TypeScript strict mode, and Supabase (database + auth + storage).

## Where things live

> **Note:** Route directories without a `page.tsx` or `route.ts` are intentionally inert — Next.js only activates routes when those files exist. Placeholder `README.md` files mark ownership; implementation is listed by ticket.

## Public routes

The following routes are publicly accessible without authentication:

- `/` — landing page placeholder (this ticket, T1).
- `/plan/[slug]` — public shareable plan page (T13).

The T4 implementer must ensure both routes bypass auth checks. The two recommended approaches are:

- **Omit them from `config.matcher`** — middleware only runs on paths listed in the matcher, so leaving `/` and `/plan/[slug]` out means the middleware never executes for those requests.
- **Use a negative-lookahead matcher** — write a single regex pattern that matches all paths *except* `/` and `/plan/:slug`, e.g. `/((?!plan/).*)` extended to exclude the root.

Alternatively, the middleware function itself may early-return `NextResponse.next()` when `req.nextUrl.pathname` matches those paths, but the matcher-exclusion approach is preferred because it avoids running middleware code at all.

---

## Environment variables

Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local` and fill in the values before running the dev server.

| Variable | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` | Yes | Your Supabase project URL |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` | Yes | Supabase anon/public key |
| `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` | Yes (server) | Service role key — never exposed to the browser |
| `NODE_ENV` | No | Defaults to `development` |

`lib/env.ts` validates all variables at import time and throws a single readable error listing every missing or invalid variable. The server variables are guarded by a browser Proxy that throws if accessed in client bundles.

Removing `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` (or running with no `.env.local`) causes any module that imports `lib/env` to throw the readable Zod schema error at import time, listing every missing or invalid variable. The current `app/page.tsx` deliberately does **not** import `lib/env` (directly or transitively), so the landing page continues to render even without environment variables — only modules that actually need env will fail. T4 will introduce the first real consumer via `lib/supabase/server`.

---

## Local Supabase backend

The local backend (Postgres, Auth, Studio, Storage, Inbucket) is managed entirely by the Supabase CLI through Docker. There is no custom `docker-compose.yml` in this repo — `pnpm db:start` is the single command to bring everything up. Production Docker assets are owned by T16.

```bash
# Requires Docker Desktop to be running
pnpm db:start   # boots the local stack; prints connection URLs when ready
pnpm db:stop    # shuts it down and releases ports
pnpm db:reset   # re-runs all migrations + seed.sql (wipes local data)
```

See `supabase/README.md` for the full workflow including migration verification.

---

## Adding shadcn components

Future contributors should run the following to add new primitives:

```bash
pnpm dlx shadcn@latest add <component>
```

`components.json` already encodes the project conventions (style: `new-york`, CSS variables, neutral base color, `@/components/ui` alias), so the CLI will place files correctly without additional flags.

---

## Phase 1 runtime libraries

The following packages were installed in Phase 1. Most are reserved for later tickets and are unused in the current codebase.

| `@tanstack/react-query-devtools ^5` _(dev)_ | Floating devtools panel — dynamically imported via `next/dynamic`, excluded from production bundles                                                                         | Dev server only                                                          |

React Query Devtools are loaded via `next/dynamic` with `{ ssr: false }` and are **only included in non-production bundles**. The `process.env.NODE_ENV !== 'production'` guard is statically inlined by Next.js, so the devtools chunk is dead-code-eliminated in `pnpm build`.

---

## Phase 3 expansion (informational)

When the CV microservice lands in Phase 3, the repository will graduate to a monorepo layout with `apps/web/` and `apps/form-analysis/`. The Gemini AI wrapper will live at `apps/web/app/api/ai/` and `apps/web/lib/ai/`.

**Do not pre-create an `apps/` directory in Phase 1** — the migration will be handled as a dedicated task when the microservice is ready.

---

## Verifying T1 acceptance

Use this checklist to confirm the T1 acceptance criteria are met:

1. `pnpm install` completes without errors.
2. `pnpm dev` starts cleanly with no console warnings; visiting `/` shows the wordmark (`LimenFit`), the verbatim tagline (`Fast workout logging. Soon: AI form analysis.`), and a working `Get Started` CTA pointing to `/auth` (404 expected until T4 lands).
3. Temporarily edit `lib/auth/session.ts` to return a fake `{ userId: 'test' }` — visiting `/` should redirect to `/home` (404 expected until T5). Revert before committing.
4. `pnpm lint`, `pnpm type-check`, `pnpm format:check`, and `pnpm build` all pass.
5. Removing `.env.local` (or omitting `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`) leaves `/` rendering, but importing `lib/env` from a REPL or test harness throws the aggregated Zod issue list.
6. The repository tree matches the "Where things live" diagram above.

---

## ESLint note

`@typescript-eslint/parser` and `@typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin` are listed explicitly in `devDependencies` so that any future ad-hoc rule overrides have a stable peer to reference, even though `eslint-config-next/typescript` (bridged via `FlatCompat`) already wires them internally.
